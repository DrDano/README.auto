  ## Description

  This package runs on node.js and generates a markdown file for you in a standard README format.

  Everything was built with javascript and is intended to formularize the structure of a standard README. This was built with the idea of package projects in mind, so if your project is intended for a browser then you might consider removing the installation section from your resulting markdown file.

  ## Installation
  First fork the project and clone the repository. Then in your CLI enter 'node install' to install all dependencies.

  This project requires Inquirer as a dependency.

  ## Usage
  In the CLI enter 'node index.js' to execute the main script. You will be led through a series of prompts and once you have completed them your markdown file will appear in the 'dist' directory.

  Keep in mind that the badges will not generate properly if you use separator characters in the 'label' 'message', or 'logo' prompts.
