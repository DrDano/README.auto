  ## Description

  This package runs on node.js and generates a markdown file for you in a standard README format.

  Everything was built with javascript and is intended to formularize the structure of a standard README. This was built with the idea of package projects in mind, so if your project is intended for a browser then you might consider removing the installation section.
